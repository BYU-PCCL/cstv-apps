- Add solution lines
- Optimize maze code to be lightning fast
- Fix random traversal and prim!
  - Initial random traversal optimization is done
  - I should probably optimize getAdjacentSquares, getX, getY
- Add FPS measurement

_Later_

- Explain that it's GENERATING mazes, not solving them
- auto-timeout
