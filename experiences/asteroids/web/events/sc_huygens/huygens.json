		"more": "After riding along with the Cassini spacecraft for nearly seven years from Earth to Saturn, the European Space Agency's Huygens probe detached from Cassini on Dec. 24, 2004. Before separation, Cassini turned so that Huygens was oriented in the attitude needed for atmospheric entry at Titan. Cassini spun the disk-like probe up to about seven revolutions per minute to stabilize Huygens for its three-week journey to Titan, and then released it at a separation velocity of about a foot per second. Cassini later fired its propulsion system to change trajectories so that it wouldn't follow Huygens to Titan's surface."
