		"blurb": "The Lucy mission will also fly by Leucus. This 40 km (25 mile) D-type asteroid rotates extremely slowly. Its day is 446 hours! This slow rotation period means that it will likely get hotter during the day and colder at night than the other asteroids, so by comparing it with other D-type asteroids we should learn more about the materials that make up these asteroids. Also, as it rotates its brightness as observed from Earth varies a lot, suggesting that it is quite elongated. Lucy will know for sure when it flies by on April 18, 2028."
