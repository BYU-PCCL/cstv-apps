		"blurb": "This asteroid will be the final encounter of Lucy's primary mission, in March of 2033. After a long journey from the Greek L4 swarm to the Trojan L5 swarm, Lucy will fly by the binary pair of asteroids (617) Patroclus and Menoetius. They are large P-type Trojans, with average diameters of 113 km and 104 km (about 70 and 65 miles), respectively. Scientists hypothesize that they may be primordial asteroids left over from the very early Solar System."
