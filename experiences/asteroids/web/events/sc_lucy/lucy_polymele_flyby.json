		"blurb": "Polymele is the smallest of Lucy's Trojan targets at 21 km (13 miles) in diameter. It is a P-type asteroid, the same type as the much larger Patroclus and Menoetius binary. This will be the first time a spacecraft has ever flown by this dark, reddish class of asteroid that is believed to be rich in organics. Scientists think that Polymele is a collisional fragment of a larger P-type asteroid, and thus it will be very interesting to compare to its larger brethren. Lucy will fly by on September 15, 2027."
