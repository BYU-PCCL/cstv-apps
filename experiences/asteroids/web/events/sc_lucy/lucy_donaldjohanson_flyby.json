		"blurb": "Named after the paleoanthropologist who discovered the \"Lucy\" fossil, this will be the first small body that the Lucy mission will encounter. This is the smallest of Lucy's targets, measuring only 4 km (2-3 miles) in diameter. While this object will mostly provide a test rehearsal for all of Lucy's instruments, it is also an interesting object itself as it has been identified as a fragment of a massive collision that occurred around 130 million years ago that produced the Erigone family of asteroids. Lucy will fly by this C-type asteroid on April 20, 2025."
