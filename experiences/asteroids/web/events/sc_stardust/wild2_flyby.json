		"blurb": "On Dec. 31, 2003, the spacecraft entered the coma of Comet Wild 2 (or 81P/Wild) with the closest encounter (at a range of 155 miles or 250 kilometers) taking place on Jan. 2, 2004. The dust sample collector, which had been deployed Dec. 24, 2003, was retracted about six hours after closest approach, stowed, and then sealed in the sample vault. The imaging system took 72 images of the cometâ€™s nucleus."
