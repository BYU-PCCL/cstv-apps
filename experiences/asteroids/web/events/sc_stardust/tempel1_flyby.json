		"blurb": "Stardust, now known as Stardust/NExT, flew by Comet Tempel 1 on Feb. 15, 2011, at a range of 112 miles (181 kilometers), returning 72 images of the nucleus. Since the Deep Impact mission had been to this comet in 2005, this was the first time a comet had been revisited. It was also during this flyby that investigators were able to conclusively identify the crater caused by the Deep Impact missionâ€™s probe."
