		"blurb": "Pioneer 11 detected Saturn’s bow shock on Aug. 31, 1979, about 932,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) out from the planet, thus providing the first conclusive evidence of the existence of Saturn’s magnetic field. The spacecraft crossed the planet’s ring plane beyond the outer ring at 14:36 UT Sept. 1, 1979, and then passed by the planet at 16:31 UT for a close encounter at a range of about 13,000 miles (20,900 kilometers). It was moving at a relative velocity of about 71,000 miles per hour (114,000 kilometers per hour) at the point of closest approach.During the encounter, the spacecraft took 440 images of the planetary system, with about 20 at a resolution of about 56 miles (90 kilometers). The images of Saturn’s moon Titan (at a resolution of 112 miles or 180 kilometers) showed a featureless orange fuzzy satellite. A brief burst of data on Titan indicated that the average global temperature of Titan was minus 315 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 193 degrees Celsius). Among Pioneer 11’s many discoveries were a narrow ring outside the A ring named the F ring and a new satellite 124 miles (200 kilometers) in diameter. The spacecraft recorded the planet’s overall temperature at minus 292 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius) and photographs indicated a more featureless atmosphere than that of Jupiter. Analysis of data suggested that the planet was primarily made of liquid hydrogen."
