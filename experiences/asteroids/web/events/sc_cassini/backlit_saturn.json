		"more": "Cassini saw some new rings and other features of the Saturn system in 2006, thanks to some unusual geometry. Because of the ever-changing shape and position of the spacecraft's orbit around Saturn, Cassini has at times been in Saturn's shadow. Astronomers call such an event a \"solar occultation\" because, from Cassini's point of view, the sun is occulted - or hidden - behind Saturn. Such events reveal features of the Saturn system that are at other times difficult to see. It's a bit like the difference between standing on a stage with a spotlight on your face versus standing in the wings of the stage. Dust particles floating in the spotlight's beam are, of course, much easier to spot from the wings where the source of light isn't shining at your eyes. Usually an occultation lasts about an hour, but on Sept. 17, 2006, Cassini experienced a 12-hour occultation - the longest of the mission at that point - during which the spacecraft discovered a faint ring outward of the bright main rings, and inward of the G and E rings. The observation also allowed the spacecraft to image the entire E ring at once for the first time, revealing unexpected details there."
