		"more": "After two Venus flybys and one Earth flyby, Cassini then flew past Jupiter on Dec. 30, 2000. The previous three flybys were all within several hundred miles of the planets' surfaces, but Cassini flew by Jupiter at a distance of about 6 million miles (9.7 million kilometers) from the planet's cloud-tops. The Galileo spacecraft, which launched in 1989, was orbiting Jupiter at the time. With Cassini passing by, scientists were able to spend several months studying the Jovian system up close with two spacecraft at the same time, which had never been done before. The Jupiter gravity assist provided Cassini with a speed boost of more than 4,000 miles per hour (about 2 kilometers per second)."
