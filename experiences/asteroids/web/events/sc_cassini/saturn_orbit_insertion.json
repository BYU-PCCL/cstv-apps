		"more": "At 7:10 p.m. EDT on June 30, 2004, Cassini turned so that its high-gain antenna could shield the rest of the spacecraft from particles as it passed through Saturn's ring plane. The spacecraft then turned again and began a main engine burn at 10:36 p.m. EDT to slow the spacecraft enough to be captured in Saturn orbit. The burn lasted 96 minutes, ending at 12:12 a.m. EDT on July 1. Cassini's first orbit was several months long, but later in the mission some orbits were as short as a week. At the time of Saturn Orbit Insertion, the mission was scheduled to end on July 1, 2008, after four years and 75 orbits. But two mission extensions stretched Cassini's time orbiting Saturn out to Sept. 15, 2017, or about 13 years and 294 orbits. The unprecedented length of time at Saturn has allowed scientists to make unexpected observations, and to study how Saturn, its rings, and its moons change over Saturn's seasons, each of which lasts more than seven Earth years."
