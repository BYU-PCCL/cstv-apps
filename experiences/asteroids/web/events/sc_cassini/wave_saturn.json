		"more": "Other spacecraft had previously taken pictures of Earth from the outer solar system - perhaps most famously, Voyager 1's \"Pale Blue Dot\"; - and on July 19, 2013, early in the afternoon (PDT), Cassini did the same. But this was the first time the public was notified beforehand that a spacecraft was taking such an image, and they were encouraged to wave at Saturn for the picture. In a way, it was the grandest and most distant selfie to date. Because Cassini was nearly 900 million miles (1.5 billion kilometers) from Earth at the time, the Earth-moon system is barely a speck in the resulting image, which was combined with 140 other images Cassini took from within Saturn's shadow to create a mosaic of the planet and its rings. The mosaic was intended to help scientists learn more about the fainter rings encircling Saturn, and it did. But it also is one of the most iconic images of the Cassini mission. The processed mosaic includes planets Venus and Mars, Saturn's largest moon Titan, Enceladus in the ring it produces, several other Saturnian moons -- and the entirety of humanity."
