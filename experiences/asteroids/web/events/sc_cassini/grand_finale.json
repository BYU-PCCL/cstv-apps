		"more": "When Cassini launched, Earthlings hadn't decided the spacecraft's ultimate fate. They considered eventually leaving Saturn to go study another of the other outer planets, but after Cassini reached Saturn, scientists began thinking that the moon Enceladus (and possibly even Titan) might be habitable for some form of life. So before Cassini completely runs out of propellant, engineers set it on a course to responsibly dispose of it in Saturn's atmosphere. They did this while they still had control of the spacecraft in order to prevent Cassini from accidentally colliding with either of those moons. Cassini's fateful plunge came with an enormous perk. The trajectory that led up to the end of mission carried it through a place where no spacecraft had ever been. Starting April 22, 2017, Cassini began its Grand Finale - a series of 22 daring dives through the 1,500-mile (2,400-kilometer) gap between the planet and the inner edge of the rings to collect incredibly rich and valuable information that the mission's original planners might never have imagined. On the final five Grand Finale orbits, Cassini dipped down and directly sampled Saturn's upper atmosphere. And on Cassini's final plunge into the atmosphere, the spacecraft transmitted its observations toward Earth in real time, until Saturn's atmosphere overpowered the spacecraft's thrusters. Shortly after that, 19 years and 11 months after launching from Earth, Cassini burned up in Saturn's upper atmosphere, becoming part of the planet itself."
