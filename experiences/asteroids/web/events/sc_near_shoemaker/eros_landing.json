		"blurb": "Following a slow, controlled descent, during which it took 69 high-resolution photos of Eros, NEAR touched down on Eros at a gentle 4 miles per hour (6.4 kilometers per hour), just south of a saddle-shaped feature named Himeros, on February 12, 2001, at 19:44 UT, becoming the first spacecraft to ever land on an asteroid. Remarkably, the spacecraft – which was not designed as a lander – survived touchdown on the asteroid and returned valuable data for about two weeks."
