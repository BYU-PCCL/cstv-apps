		"blurb": "As the spacecraft approached the moon's south pole, the upper stage separated, and then impacted a crater in the south pole area. A plume from the upper stage crash developed as the \"Shepherding Spacecraft\" LCROSS headed toward the moon. The 880-kilogram LCROSS probe flew through the resulting plume and used its instruments to scan for water while taking photographs. Fifteen minutes after the upper stage booster's impact, the LCROSS spacecraft also crashed into the crater floor."
