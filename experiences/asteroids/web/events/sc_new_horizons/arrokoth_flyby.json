		"blurb": "On Jan. 1, 2019, New Horizons flew past Arrokoth, a Kuiper Belt Object that is approximately 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) from Earth, making it the farthest object ever studied in human history. Initial images hinted at a reddish, snowman-like shape, but further analysis of images taken near closest approach — New Horizons came to within just 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers)—revealed just how unusual the object’s shape really is. At about 22 miles (35 kilometers) long, Arrokoth consists of a large, flat lobe connected to a smaller, rounder lobe. The strange shape was the biggest surprise of the flyby, somewhat resembling a red snowman. No rings or moons were spotted."
