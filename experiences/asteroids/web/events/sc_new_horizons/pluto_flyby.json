		"blurb": "NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is the first spacecraft to explore Pluto up close, flying by the dwarf planet and its moons on July 14, 2015. The spacecraft flew about 4,800 miles (7,800 kilometers) above the surface of Pluto. Besides collecting data on Pluto and Charon, New Horizons also observed Pluto’s other satellites, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. Stunning photographs showed a vast heart-shaped nitrogen glacier on the surface. It’s about 600-miles wide (1,000 kilometers), undoubtedly the largest known glacier in the solar system. On Charon, images showed an enormous equatorial extension tectonic belt, suggesting a long-past water-ice ocean."
