		"more": "The deep space manuevers are designed to pick up speed, in order to slingshot around the Earth in October of 2013 at an even faster rate. This enables the spacecraft to make it to Jupiter without needing too much fuel.  The DSMs feature the use of the main engine and were both roughly 30-minutes long."
