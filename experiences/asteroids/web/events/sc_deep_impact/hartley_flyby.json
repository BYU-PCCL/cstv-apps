		"blurb": "Although Deep Impactâ€™s primary mission was over, because the flyby vehicle still had plenty of propellant, on July 3, 2007, NASA approved a new supplemental mission for Deep Impact, known as EPOXI. The spacecraft was eventually redirected towards Comet Hartley 2, also known as 103P/Hartley. On November 4th, 2010, the spacecraft conducted its flyby of the target at a range of about 430 miles (694 kilometers), taking many highly detailed images of the comet. After this encounter, the mission focused on studying other comets from further distances before communication was lost in August of 2013."
