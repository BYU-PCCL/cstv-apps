		"blurb": "On the 4th of July, 2005, the 820 pound (372 kilogram) impactor probe crashed into Comet Tempel 1 at a relative velocity of 23,000 mph (37,000 kph). A camera on the impactor took pictures all the way until three seconds before impact and transmitted them safely to Deep Impact. The impact generated an explosion the equivalent of 4.7 tons of TNT and a crater estimated to be about 490 feet (150 meters) in diameter. Minutes after the impact, the flyby probe passed the nucleus at a range of about 310 miles (500 kilometers) and took images of the crater (although it was obscured by the dust cloud), ejecta plume, and the entire nucleus."
