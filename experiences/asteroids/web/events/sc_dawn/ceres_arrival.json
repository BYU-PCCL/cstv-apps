		"blurb": "After a journey of two and a half years, Dawn arrived at the dwarf planet Ceres on March 6th, 2015, becoming the first mission in history to study a dwarf planet at close range, beating the New Horizons mission to Pluto by only four months. The spacecraft is still in orbit around Ceres to this day, but ran out of fuel in 2018, triggering the formal end of the mission. It is estimated that the spacecraft will orbit for another twenty years, eventually impacting the surface of Ceres. The spacecraft made many discoveries about Ceres that will be studied for decades to come."
