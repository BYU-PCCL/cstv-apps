In this demo, we're using deep neural networks to combine the style of one image (in this case, a famous painting) with the content of another image (in this case, images from a webcam).<br><br>The technique relies on something called a \"deep neural network\", or DNN.<br><br>In this demo, a DNN that was trained to recognize images is carefully analyzed to separate style and content of images, and then a second DNN is trained to produce new images that can mix arbitrary style images with arbitrary content images. Some combinations work better than others!<br><br>Try playing with different styles by scanning the QR code below.",
